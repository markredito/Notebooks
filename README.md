1. [Summarizing Dialogies with LLMs (Colab Notebook)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16phGf3EUUisSo3aT4QL1JOpLQRp6hRyp?usp=sharing) - a hands-on guide from a Generative AI course by DeepLearning.AI and AWS. It begins by setting up the environment, installing libraries like torch and transformers. The content then shifts to dialogue summarization, importing modules such as AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM and AutoTokenizer. A key section sources dialogues from Hugging Face's "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset, demonstrating practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in summarizing dialogues.
